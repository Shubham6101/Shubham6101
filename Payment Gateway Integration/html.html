                Your donations have changed lives.
                A small amount can change the life of a child; through education, nutrition, and basic protection,
                children can lead normal lives. The adjacent graph is a representation of how we have utilised your
                donations.

                TO PROVIDE EVERY CHILD A TOOL TO WRITE HIS OWN DESTINY
                <span><br>
                    Save the Children is India’s leading independent child rights’ NGO, which works in 18 states of the
                    country. Beginning its journey in 2008 in India, and registered as ‘Bal Raksha Bharat’, we have
                    changed the lives of more than 11 million (1.1 crore) children.

                    We firmly believe that every child deserves the best chance for a bright future, which is why, we
                    are fiercely committed to ensure that children not only survive, but thrive. With a bold ambition
                    and a powerful vigilance, we do whatever it takes to save the children.
